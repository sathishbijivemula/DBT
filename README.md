🚀 dbt Data Transformation Project

This repository contains my hands-on work and implementation from the Complete dbt Bootcamp course on Udemy. It serves as my learning workspace where I build, test, and optimize data transformation models using dbt (Data Build Tool).

📌 Project Overview

In this project, I:

Build and manage dbt models

Implement data transformations following analytics engineering best practices

Create staging, intermediate, and mart layers

Write tests and documentation

Work with sources and seeds

Apply modular, scalable data modeling techniques

This repository reflects my practical understanding of dbt workflows and modern data transformation strategies.

🛠 Getting Started

You can run this project in two ways:

Option 1: Use GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

Open this repository in GitHub.

Start a new Codespace.

Begin running dbt commands directly in the integrated terminal.

Option 2: Run Locally with VS Code

Clone this repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>

Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

Set up your local dbt environment.

Install dependencies:

dbt deps

Run models:

dbt run
📚 What This Project Demonstrates
